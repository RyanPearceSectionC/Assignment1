                <h2>What is programming? [Introduction]</h2>
                <p>Programming is a language and tool used by software developers to make <label class="important-text">a set of instructions that the computer will handle and execute</label>. It can range from basic programs, such as adding up a bunch of numbers, to advanced ones like object-oriented programming and application creation.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of different functionality to programming and I'm going to show you one of the languages, C#. This is one of the languages I went into programming learning and I think it's a good place to start as it's clean and simple with little room to accidentally mess something up, though strict enough to learn that every keystroke matters.</p>
                <p>When you feel like you've learned enough or you're confident in what you learned, you can take a quick and fun quiz at the top of the page.</p>
                <p>I will be supplying pictures, video and advice for programming!</p>

                <h2>What exactly is C#?</h2>
                <p>C# is a programming language that was created with the intention and mind of making an easier and better version of C++. Unfortunately, due to it's restrictions, C# is slower than C++ but it's much easier to organize, manage and review code in my personal opinion.</p>
                <p>C# is, in my opinion again, <label class="important-text">a language that will help you decide if you wish to get into programming</label>. It's classes have everything together so it's easy to read compared to C++ which has two files for one class. C# doesn't have as much access to creating programs or anything super advanced without using .NET or some sort of alternative programming language behind the scenes.</p>

                <h2>Where can I Start?</h2>
                <p>Futher down this page will be a very basic explaination of C# programming. It will not cover the main function/method or classes/structures. It will only cover variables, if statement and loops.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, here are a few links that'll help you learn the basics of C# programming outside of this website:</p>

                <h2>What Tools Do I Need?</h2>
                <p>Down Below, I am going to send links, along what their background. These are some compilers which will allow you to program in C#.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><a class="important-text" href="https://www.google.ca">Visual Studio</a></dt>
                        <dd>Visual Studio is a tool that is used widely with good reason. It's quick to set-up, it has everything you could ask for, has intelli-sense to help you remember and put in methods/functions into your code fast. You really can't go wrong with it.</dd>
                    <dt><a class="important-text" href="https://www.google.ca">Visual Studio - Code</a></dt>
                        <dd>Visual Studio Code is good for smaller or more closed projects. It's basically just Visual Studio Lite. The only thing to note about this compared to Visual Studio is that the hierchy system is a little strange and you are limited away from .NET plugins and are instead forced to use their plugins if you wish to do something specific. Chances are, there is something that allows .NET support but until then, you're limited when using something like C#.</dd>
                    <dt><a class="important-text" href="https://www.google.ca">Sublime Text 3</a>
                        <dd>Sublime Text 3 is a difficult but efficient and customizable text editor/compiler. You don't get the benefit to intell-sense like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code does but in return, you have an easy to understand compiler that you are able to put the inputs in for yourself. If you can figure out what compiler you want to use and how you want to use it, this would be a good option. If not, I would say refer to the previous two.</dd>
                    <dt><a class="important-text" href="https://www.google.ca">Notepad++</a>
                        <dd>Notepad++ is a text editor and shouldn't really be used for compiling but if you plan to write things like HTML or little scripts then it's definitely something to look into. It's basically if Visual Studio and Notepad fused together with both a community that will create 'intelli-sense'-like scripts that will help you on your programming/scripting journey. Unless you are certain that what you have is in there though, I would stick to Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.</dd>
