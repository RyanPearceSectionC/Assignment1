				<h2>Programming is Everywhere!</h2>
				<p>Hello! Welcome to my website about Programming! This site will cover what is programming, what tools
					programmers can use and why I love programming so much. Before we can get into that though, we must
					ask the question 'what is programming'.<br>Simply put, it is what allows us to do really anything on
					the computer. You looking at this page is due to programming. You can find programming:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Applications/Tools</dt>
					<dd>Programming can affect many basic little things such as an eletronic calendar, a calculator,
						printers, and many more devices that people use on a daily basis.</dd>
					<dt>Games and Media</dt>
					<dd>Do you like games? Maybe TV or movies? Well, that's all thanks to programming! All of these may
						have different ways of being handled but at the end of the day, it is very program heavy stuff
						out on the internet.</dd>
					<dt>The Internet</dt>
					<dd>The World Wide Web (WWW) was created with hardware that allowed people to connect to other
						computers. The reason why it's here is because in order to get access to those sites and see
						them properly, you need a web browser which is, you guessed it, programmed.'</dd>

			<h2>What Tools Do Programmers Use/Need?</h2>
			<p>There are quite a few different tools that developers can use for Programming. There is never really
				'set' tools that a developer must use but there are definitely a lot of options that'll help you out.
				The most important to me is the text editor as it can make your journey crystal clear or confusing.</p>

					<th class="main-table-header">Description</th>
					<th class="main-table-header">Link</th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<th class="main-table-border">Visual Studio</th>
					<th class="main-table-border">Visual Studio is a tool that is used widely with good reason. It's
						quick to set-up, it has everything you could ask for, has intelli-sense to help you remember and
						put in methods/functions into your code fast. You really can't go wrong with it.</th>
					<th class="main-table-border"><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Click Here!</a></th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<th class="main-table-border">Visual Studio - Code</th>
					<th class="main-table-border">Visual Studio Code is good for smaller or more closed projects. It's
						basically just Visual Studio Lite. The only thing to note about this compared to Visual Studio
						is that the hierchy system is a little strange and you are limited away from .NET plugins and
						are instead forced to use their plugins if you wish to do something specific. Chances are, there
						is something that allows .NET support but until then, you're limited when using something like
						C#.</th>
					<th class="main-table-border"><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Click Here!</a></th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<th class="main-table-border">Sublime Text</th>
					<th class="main-table-border">Sublime Text 3 is a difficult but efficient and customizable text
						editor/compiler. You don't get the benefit to intell-sense like Visual Studio and Visual Studio
						Code does but in return, you have an easy to understand compiler that you are able to put the
						inputs in for yourself. If you can figure out what compiler you want to use and how you want to
						use it, this would be a good option. If not, I would say refer to the previous two.</th>
					<th class="main-table-border"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Click Here!</a></th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<th class="main-table-border">Notepad++</th>
					<th class="main-table-border">Notepad++ is a text editor and shouldn't really be used for compiling
						but if you plan to write things like HTML or little scripts then it's definitely something to
						look into. It's basically if Visual Studio and Notepad fused together with both a community that
						will create 'intelli-sense'-like scripts that will help you on your programming/scripting
						journey. Unless you are certain that what you have is in there though, I would stick to Visual
						Studio and Visual Studio Code.</th>

			<h2>If I Wanted to Get Into Programming, Where Should I Start?</h2>
			<p>There are a lot of different options for learning programming, some of them involve heavy amounts of
				reading while others have direct interaction while you learn. All of these different websites can help
				you learn programming of any kind but I have linked my favorite language C# as it's not too hard but not
				too easy either:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a class="link-text" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">Microsoft's C#
						Introduction</a></li>
				<li><a class="link-text" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp">Code Academy</a></li>
				<li><a class="link-text" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php">W3Schools</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I highly suggest W3Schools as it is very interactive, easy to understand and even fun to go through!
				Added, it helps with a lot of programming languages to help pretty much anyone who's planning on getting
				into programming.'</p>

			<h2>A Quick Starter Video!</h2>
			<p>Here is a quick video that you can watch that will help you on your journey to get into C# programming!
				Only watch this if you wish to see the benefits of using C# further. I would at very least recommend
				checking it out as it does seem pretty informational about C#'s usage and strengths. However, don't take
				my word for it as a lot of people have better experience and time programming with other languages like
				Python or Java. This is only if you plan on going to program in C#.</p>
